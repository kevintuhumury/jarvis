# Jarvis

Jarvis is a (Rails 4.1) bootstrapped themed admin interface. Jarvis or actually J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is Tony Stark's (Marvel) artificially intelligent computer and basically does anything he wants. Jarvis in our case isn't an artificially intelligent computer, but an admin interface that helps you with your content.
